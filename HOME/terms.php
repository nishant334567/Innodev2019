TINNODEV Accounts will be accessed through a username and password that You will create (Your “Credentials”). Your Credentials are solely for Your use and must not be shared. Each TINNODEV online community (each “Hacker”), needs to have his or her own TINNODEV Account and Credentials. You agree that Your Credentials and information You provide upon registration of Your TINNODEV Account and at all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete.

Content.<br><hr>
These Terms will remain in full force and effect while You use TINNODEV. Those terms that can continue to operate after You stop using TINNODEV (including without limitation Your Content license to Us and the general terms in this Section), will survive after You stop using TINNODEV.
You agree that regardless of any statute of law to the contrary or any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of TINNODEV or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
You agree that We may provide You with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms, via notification through TINNODEV’s notification functionality.
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign Your TINNODEV Account or any rights and licenses granted hereunder and such any assignment by You will be null and void.
<br><hr>
All sections of these Terms that by their respective nature should survive the cancellation or termination of these Terms shall survive the termination or cancellation of these Terms.
